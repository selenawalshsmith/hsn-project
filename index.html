      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p>
        For our project we decided to work with a company called Health Network Solutions Now (HNSNow). This company is somewhat new and has been established for about three years. They are involved in the computer science world because they sell their software which they created, and it helps startup companies manage their business. It can handle things such as personal information and others such as accounts receivable. The intent is to teach us how to work with new tools and environments. It will help us understand how to adapt and work in a team environment and to specific needs of a company. We wanted something that can challenge us but within our skill capabilities. Since were all somewhat new to computer science it’s good to try and get a well-rounded understanding in the field. Doing this project will allow us to work together as a team and be able to accomplish the tasks placed in front of us.

      <h3>Specifications</h3>
      <p>
        Working with HNSNow will be a fantastic opportunity. We will become more familiar with SQL database systems and working in a team. It’s exciting to be able to research things that truly interest us and can fuel opportunities for the future.  We are working on HNSNOW’s database code offline from their server. This will ensure version control on their end. In order to complete the task, we are using Windows Visual with the extension APEX SQL. This tool will be effective as it has many useful tools and will keep us uniform in our work. We are each going to accomplish 10 procedures of formatting with a total of 30 procedures each week to be formatted. Furthermore, we are creating a spreadsheet using google docs which will ensure version control is maintained. This will allow us to see real time if someone is working on the current version of the SQL code.  It creates an understanding that if another person is working on that version after they need to ensure they’re work doesn’t conflict with the already checked out version. We will also utilize Virtual Machines in the event we need to work within their system so we can RDP to make transfer of files and accessing their system simpler. As well, this will greatly improve our abilities as computer scientist and give us a greater understanding of a working world. All these aspects are import because they can help us understand further a working environment in computer science.

      <h3>Milestones</h3>
      <h5>Researching Tools</h5>
      <p>In order to effectively complete the work ahead of us our team is going to need to decide what tools we will all need to use. This will allow us to effectively format SQL code and allow us to complete or tasks in a timely manner.</p>
      <h5>Initiate a Functional Work Plan</h5>
      <p>We will create a walkthrough check sheet. A check sheet will ensure we are uniform in our formatting. This makes the process more effective, so we won’t do the same work twice or copy over another person’s completed work.</p>
      <h5>All SQL Code Reformatted</h5>
      <p>This will be the goal to have all code formatted and completed to HNSNow’s specifications. As well, to ensure the formatted code not only meets specifications but still functional within the database.</p>
