              <p>During our first meeting with David and Dennis we learned a bit about their company, Healthnet Solutions Now. HSN is a small, family owned tech startup selling medical billing services to genetic labs. These medical labs are all throughout the country, but mostly in California. HSN is 100% virtual and provides revenue cycle management for these clinics. David told us that their software is part of a very niche and difficult market. Their customers are start-ups -- genetic testing is still an emerging area of medical research, and is not yet totally established as a discipline.</p>

We use the meeting to try and figure out how we are going to work in their environment. No conclusions were made at the time but some ideas were thrown out such as using virtual machines.</p>

                 <p>Daniel McMillan conducted research using youtube videos about Software as a Service (SaaS). It is a way for people to distribute their software in an affordable manner. It allows clients to work in a person’s program usually through a portal or some kind of server and allows the server side to constantly update and provide support on their end. However, it does have some disadvantages since the client is relient on the server side. And it is up to the provider of the software to continue to develop the software to specific needs of the client.</p>

                 <p>This week we started the next step towards reformatting SQL code for Health Solutions Now. We began to develop a checklist and a guide for what the finished SQL code should look like after formatting. This includes cleaning up white spaces (indentation), case control, and standardizing begin and end statements. Currently, we are exmining different SQL formatting tools, mostly as plug ins for Visual Studio IDE.</p>
